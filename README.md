# Weather Project
The Weather project is a data analysis and visualization project that examines historical global temperature trends. It is divided into two main parts:

### Overview
1) Data Analysis and Visualization - exploring global temperature data over centuries, highlighting significant trends across cities:
- the first graph represents the top 3 Cities with largest temperature changes Across 5 historical periods
- the second one analyses the city with the largest temperature change over a 20-year period
- the third visualization underlines the standard deviation of temperatures for each city
2) Warmest Route Calculation:
- lets the user choose a year
- given the year, alculates the warmest route between two cities, Beijing and Los Angeles, by analyzing historical temperature data and representing the route on a world map.

### Data Sources
The project uses the following datasets from [the Kaggle Global Land Temperatures Dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data):
- `GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv`
- `GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv`
