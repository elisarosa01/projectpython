# Weather Project
The Weather project is a data analysis and visualization project that examines historical global temperature trends. It is divided into two main parts:

# Overview
1) Data Analysis and Visualization: explores global temperature data over centuries, highlighting significant trends across cities.
2) Warmest Route Calculation: calculates the warmest route between two cities, Beijing and Los Angeles, by analyzing historical temperature data and representing the route on a world map.

## Data Sources
The project uses the following datasets from [the Kaggle Global Land Temperatures Dataset:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data):
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv
